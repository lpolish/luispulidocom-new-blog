# Mid-2025 Update on HIPAA, AI and Biotech
## Introduction

In our May 5th post, we examined how AI-powered security and HIPAA compliance intersect in modern healthcare systems. Since then, the Department of Health and Human Services has issued updates and the industry has adopted new technical measures. This post provides concrete guidance for professionals implementing these changes, including code examples and configuration samples.

## 1. HIPAA Guidance on AI Tools and Validation

In June 2025, HHS published clarifications to the HIPAA Security Rule, explicitly recognizing AI-based administrative safeguards. Covered entities and business associates must:

- Generate tamper-proof audit logs for every AI decision point, with entries stored for a minimum of six years
- Validate model performance and bias annually using a standardized test set simulating common access patterns
- Use federated learning to improve model accuracy without sharing raw PHI, under signed Data Use Agreements (DUAs)
- Provide human-readable decision rationales when access or data transformations are denied or masked

Example TypeScript middleware for logging AI decisions:

```typescript
import fs from 'fs';

interface AIDecisionEntry {
	timestamp: string;
	userId: string;
	resourceId: string;
	decision: 'allow' | 'deny';
	reason: string;
	score: number;
}

export function recordDecision(entry: AIDecisionEntry) {
	const line = JSON.stringify(entry);
	fs.appendFileSync('logs/ai_decisions.log', line + '\n');
}
```

## 2. AI Governance and Compliance Automation

Managing AI policies at scale requires policy-as-code and automated checks. A common pattern combines Open Policy Agent (OPA) with ML pipelines:

- Write HIPAA rules in Rego and store them alongside service code
- Integrate policy evaluation into request pipelines, rejecting unauthorized calls in real time
- Schedule daily scans to compare live logs against policy changes and open JIRA tickets for drift

Rego snippet enforcing key rotation every 90 days:

```rego
package hipaa.access

rotate_keys {
	input.daysSinceLastRotation > 90
}
```

Execute a scan:

```bash
opa eval --data policies/hipaa.rego --input samples/key_status.json \ 
	"data.hipaa.access.rotate_keys"
```

## 3. Securing Genomic Data with SMPC and Homomorphic Encryption

Genomic data requires higher privacy safeguards. Recent solutions combine:

- Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) to split encrypted shares across nodes
- Homomorphic Encryption (HE) to allow arithmetic on encrypted data without decryption
- Risk thresholds defined in HIPAA guidance, classifying raw sequences as PHI when re-identification risk exceeds 0.01%

Example using TenSEAL to compute encrypted sums:

```python
import tenseal as ts

# Create CKKS context
ctx = ts.context(
		ts.SCHEME_TYPE.CKKS,
		poly_modulus_degree=8192,
		coeff_mod_bit_sizes=[60, 40, 40, 60]
)

# Encrypt two sample vectors
v1 = ts.ckks_vector(ctx, [0.8, 1.2, 0.5])
v2 = ts.ckks_vector(ctx, [0.4, 0.6, 0.3])

encrypted_sum = v1 + v2
print(encrypted_sum.decrypt())  # [1.2, 1.8, 0.8]
```

## 4. Quantum-Resistant and Zero-Trust Deployments

As quantum threats emerge, hospitals are piloting lattice-based algorithms (Kyber) and zero-trust network designs:

- Kyber key exchange protects device uplinks across clinical environments
- Microsegmentation isolates services (EHR, PACS) using network policies
- Mutual TLS extended with certificate and device posture checks

Cilium policy example for PACS isolation:

```yaml
apiVersion: cilium.io/v2
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
	name: pacs-isolation
spec:
	endpointSelector:
		matchLabels:
			app: pacs-server
	ingress:
	- fromEndpoints:
		- matchLabels:
				role: radiologist
```

## 5. Model Governance and Patient Consent

Robust AI governance links models, decisions and patient consent:

- Maintain a model registry including version, training data hash, and explainability report
- Capture patient consent flags and integrate them into access-control policies
- Align HIPAA requirements with GDPR for cross-border data sharing in clinical trials
- Conduct red-team exercises targeting AI decision flows at least biannually

## Conclusion

This mid-2025 update highlights practical steps and code examples to implement the latest HIPAA and AI guidance. By combining audit logging, policy-as-code, encrypted computation and zero-trust networks, healthcare organizations can protect sensitive data while meeting compliance requirements. Ongoing collaboration between IT, compliance and data science teams will be essential as regulations and technologies evolve.
