# Mid-2025 Update on HIPAA, AI and Biotech
## Introduction

In our May 5th post, we examined how AI-powered security and HIPAA compliance intersect in modern healthcare systems. Since then, the Department of Health and Human Services has issued updates and the industry has adopted new technical measures. This post provides concrete guidance for professionals implementing these changes, including code examples and configuration samples.

## 1. HIPAA Guidance on AI Tools and Validation

In June 2025, HHS published clarifications to the HIPAA Security Rule, explicitly recognizing AI-based administrative safeguards. Covered entities and business associates must:

- Generate tamper-proof audit logs for every AI decision point, with entries stored for a minimum of six years
- Validate model performance and bias annually using a standardized test set simulating common access patterns
- Use federated learning to improve model accuracy without sharing raw PHI, under signed Data Use Agreements (DUAs)
- Provide human-readable decision rationales when access or data transformations are denied or masked

Example TypeScript middleware for logging AI decisions:

```typescript
import fs from 'fs';

interface AIDecisionEntry {
	timestamp: string;
	userId: string;
	resourceId: string;
	decision: 'allow' | 'deny';
	reason: string;
	score: number;
}

export function recordDecision(entry: AIDecisionEntry) {
	const line = JSON.stringify(entry);
	fs.appendFileSync('logs/ai_decisions.log', line + '\n');
}
```

## 2. AI Governance and Compliance Automation

Managing AI policies at scale requires policy-as-code and automated checks. A common pattern combines Open Policy Agent (OPA) with ML pipelines:

- Write HIPAA rules in Rego and store them alongside service code
- Integrate policy evaluation into request pipelines, rejecting unauthorized calls in real time
- Schedule daily scans to compare live logs against policy changes and open JIRA tickets for drift

Rego snippet enforcing key rotation every 90 days:

```rego
package hipaa.access

rotate_keys {
	input.daysSinceLastRotation > 90
}
```

Execute a scan:

```bash
opa eval --data policies/hipaa.rego --input samples/key_status.json \ 
	"data.hipaa.access.rotate_keys"
```

## 3. Securing Genomic Data with SMPC and Homomorphic Encryption

Genomic data requires higher privacy safeguards. Recent solutions combine:

- Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) to split encrypted shares across nodes
- Homomorphic Encryption (HE) to allow arithmetic on encrypted data without decryption
- Risk thresholds defined in HIPAA guidance, classifying raw sequences as PHI when re-identification risk exceeds 0.01%

Example using TenSEAL to compute encrypted sums:

```python
import tenseal as ts

# Create CKKS context
ctx = ts.context(
		ts.SCHEME_TYPE.CKKS,
		poly_modulus_degree=8192,
		coeff_mod_bit_sizes=[60, 40, 40, 60]
)

# Encrypt two sample vectors
v1 = ts.ckks_vector(ctx, [0.8, 1.2, 0.5])
v2 = ts.ckks_vector(ctx, [0.4, 0.6, 0.3])

encrypted_sum = v1 + v2
print(encrypted_sum.decrypt())  # [1.2, 1.8, 0.8]
```

## 4. Quantum-Resistant and Zero-Trust Deployments

As quantum threats emerge, hospitals are piloting lattice-based algorithms (Kyber) and zero-trust network designs:

- Kyber key exchange protects device uplinks across clinical environments
- Microsegmentation isolates services (EHR, PACS) using network policies
- Mutual TLS extended with certificate and device posture checks

Cilium policy example for PACS isolation:

```yaml
apiVersion: cilium.io/v2
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
	name: pacs-isolation
spec:
	endpointSelector:
		matchLabels:
			app: pacs-server
	ingress:
	- fromEndpoints:
		- matchLabels:
				role: radiologist
```

## 5. Model Governance and Patient Consent

Robust AI governance links models, decisions and patient consent:

- Maintain a model registry including version, training data hash, and explainability report
- Capture patient consent flags and integrate them into access-control policies
- Align HIPAA requirements with GDPR for cross-border data sharing in clinical trials
- Conduct red-team exercises targeting AI decision flows at least biannually

## Conclusion

This mid-2025 update highlights practical steps and code examples to implement the latest HIPAA and AI guidance. By combining audit logging, policy-as-code, encrypted computation and zero-trust networks, healthcare organizations can protect sensitive data while meeting compliance requirements. Ongoing collaboration between IT, compliance and data science teams will be essential as regulations and technologies evolve.

## 1. HIPAA Regulatory Enhancements for AI

In June 2025, HHS revised the HIPAA Security Rule to include AI-based administrative safeguards. Organizations must now:

- Produce immutable audit logs for AI decisions, retained for six years
- Perform annual performance tests on models using simulated datasets
- Adopt federated learning under signed Data Use Agreements (DUAs)
- Provide clear, human-readable rationales for critical AI outcomes

Example log function in TypeScript:

```typescript
import fs from 'fs';

interface AIDecisionLog {
	timestamp: string;
	userId: string;
	resourceId: string;
	action: 'approve' | 'deny';
	reason: string;
	score: number;
}

export function logAIDecision(entry: AIDecisionLog) {
	fs.appendFileSync('logs/ai_decisions.log', JSON.stringify(entry) + '\n');
}
```

## 2. AI Governance and Compliance Automation

Combining Open Policy Agent (OPA) with ML pipelines enforces HIPAA rules at runtime. Common approaches:

- Policy-as-code: encode rules in Rego and test against live event data
- AI-assisted policy updates: generate governance docs from audit logs
- Scheduled scans: detect policy drift and open review tickets

Rego example for key rotation:

```rego
package hipaa.rules

rotate_keys {
	input.keyAgeDays > 90
}
```

Run with:

```bash
opa eval --data hipaa.rego --input key_status.json data.hipaa.rules.rotate_keys
```

## 3. Bioinformatics and Genomic Privacy

New techniques combine secure multi-party computation (SMPC) with homomorphic encryption (HE):

- SMPC splits computation across nodes for speed and fault tolerance
- HE libraries (e.g., Microsoft SEAL) allow arithmetic on encrypted genomic data
- HIPAA now treats raw sequences as PHI when re-identification risk exceeds 0.01%

Example using TenSEAL in Python:

```python
import tenseal as ts

# Setup CKKS context
ctx = ts.context(ts.SCHEME_TYPE.CKKS, poly_modulus_degree=8192,
				 coeff_mod_bit_sizes=[60, 40, 40, 60])

v1 = ts.ckks_vector(ctx, [1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
v2 = ts.ckks_vector(ctx, [4.0, 5.0, 6.0])

encrypted_sum = v1 + v2
print(encrypted_sum.decrypt())  # [5.0, 7.0, 9.0]
```

## 4. Quantum-Resistant & Zero-Trust Implementations

Pilot projects in hospitals include:

- Lattice-based key exchange (Kyber) for device uplinks
- Microsegmentation with network policies per service
- Mutual TLS with device posture checks

Cilium policy sample:

```yaml
apiVersion: cilium.io/v2
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
	name: pacs-isolation
spec:
	endpointSelector:
		matchLabels:
			app: pacs-server
	ingress:
	- fromEndpoints:
		- matchLabels:
				role: radiologist
```

## 5. Emerging Best Practices

To align AI with HIPAA:

- Maintain a versioned model registry with metrics and explainability reports
- Integrate patient consent preferences into access policies
- Harmonize U.S. HIPAA and EU GDPR for multi-country studies
- Conduct red-team tests targeting AI decision workflows quarterly

## Looking Ahead

Key focus areas:

- Standardize AI audit logs in JSON-ADF format
- Feed AI logs into SIEM and SOAR platforms for real-time alerts
- Contribute to upcoming NIST AI risk management guidelines

Close collaboration among compliance, security and data teams will keep AI deployments secure and practical.
