# Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman: Mathematical Foundations and Implementation

## Mathematical Prerequisites

### Finite Fields
A finite field (or Galois field) is a field with a finite number of elements. For ECDH, we primarily work with:
- Prime fields: GF(p) where p is a prime number
- Binary fields: GF(2^m) where m is a positive integer

### Elliptic Curves over Finite Fields
An elliptic curve E over a finite field F is defined by the Weierstrass equation:

```
y² = x³ + ax + b
```

where a, b ∈ F and 4a³ + 27b² ≠ 0 (to ensure the curve is non-singular).

## Point Operations

### Point Addition
Given two points P = (x₁, y₁) and Q = (x₂, y₂) on the curve:
- If P ≠ Q:
  - λ = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁)
  - x₃ = λ² - x₁ - x₂
  - y₃ = λ(x₁ - x₃) - y₁
- If P = Q (point doubling):
  - λ = (3x₁² + a)/(2y₁)
  - x₃ = λ² - 2x₁
  - y₃ = λ(x₁ - x₃) - y₁

### Scalar Multiplication
Given a point P and an integer k, scalar multiplication kP is defined as:
```
kP = P + P + ... + P (k times)
```

## The ECDH Protocol

### Parameter Selection
1. Choose a finite field F
2. Select curve parameters a, b ∈ F
3. Choose a base point G of large prime order n
4. The cofactor h = |E(F)|/n should be small

### Key Generation
1. Private key: Random integer d ∈ [1, n-1]
2. Public key: Q = dG

### Key Exchange
1. Alice generates (d_A, Q_A)
2. Bob generates (d_B, Q_B)
3. They exchange public keys
4. Shared secret: S = d_AQ_B = d_BQ_A

## Security Analysis

### Hard Problems
1. **Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)**
   - Given P and Q = kP, find k
   - Best known attack: Pollard's rho algorithm with complexity O(√n)

2. **Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Problem (ECDHP)**
   - Given P, aP, bP, find abP
   - No known efficient solution if ECDLP is hard

### Security Parameters
| Security Level (bits) | Field Size (bits) | Example Curves |
|----------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 128                  | 256               | P-256, Curve25519 |
| 192                  | 384               | P-384           |
| 256                  | 521               | P-521           |

## Implementation Considerations

### Curve Selection
1. **NIST Curves**
   - P-256, P-384, P-521
   - Well-documented but concerns about NIST's role in standardization

2. **Alternative Curves**
   - Curve25519: Designed for performance and security
   - Brainpool curves: Developed by German standards body

### Side-Channel Attacks
1. **Timing Attacks**
   - Implement constant-time scalar multiplication
   - Use Montgomery ladder for point multiplication

2. **Power Analysis**
   - Implement point blinding
   - Use randomized projective coordinates

## Protocol Integration

### TLS 1.3
1. Supported curves: x25519, x448, P-256, P-384, P-521
2. Key exchange: Ephemeral ECDH (ECDHE)
3. Authentication: ECDSA or EdDSA

### Signal Protocol
1. X3DH: Extended Triple Diffie-Hellman
2. Double Ratchet: Combines ECDH with hash ratchets
3. Perfect forward secrecy through ephemeral keys

## Performance Optimization

### Point Representation
1. **Affine Coordinates**
   - (x, y) format
   - Requires field inversion

2. **Projective Coordinates**
   - (X, Y, Z) format
   - Avoids field inversion
   - Faster point operations

### Implementation Techniques
1. **Window Methods**
   - Fixed window
   - Sliding window
   - Comb method

2. **Parallel Computation**
   - SIMD operations
   - Multi-core processing

## Standards and Specifications

1. **NIST Standards**
   - FIPS 186-4: Digital Signature Standard
   - SP 800-56A: Key Agreement

2. **IETF Standards**
   - RFC 7748: Elliptic Curves for Security
   - RFC 8446: TLS 1.3
